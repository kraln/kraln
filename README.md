### It's Jeff Katz!

I have always been interested in electronics and computers. As a young man I became a serial entrepreneur, founding companies in a wide variety of industries including security, finance, and IT. With my background combining engineering, computer science, and business, I am at once a forward-thinking technologist and a practical engineer. My ‘niche’ is data-driven businesses, from collection (typically connected devices) through transport, aggregation, and the products and services which sit on top.
